Pong/Breakout
-------------
I called this pong but then was reminded that it more closely resembles the 80's style game Breakout.  The game is built on the STM32F429 Discovery board and implements the touchscreen to move the paddle, a user button to toggle between game modes, and DAC output for sound.  The object of the game is to bounce the ball off angry bird images to clear the screen.  The game speed increases each level.  Low level hardware drivers were auto generated using STCube tool and the project built using TrueStudio.
